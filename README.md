# Heart Disease Predictor using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting heart diseases using advanced machine-learning algorithms. 
It aims to provide early warnings and insights to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions
for better patient outcomes

### Background
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early detection and intervention are crucial in reducing mortality 
and improving the quality of life for patients. Medical practitioners use various clinical parameters and diagnostic 
tests to identify the risk of heart disease.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of heart
disease based on a set of clinical parameters. The model will analyze input features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol
levels, and other relevant metrics to determine the likelihood of a patient having heart disease.

### Dataset Description
The dataset comprises 270 patients with the following clinical parameters:

- **Age**: Age of the patient in years
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **Chest pain type**: Type of chest pain experienced (values 1, 2, 3, 4)
- **BP**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **FBS over 120**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- **EKG results**: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
- **Max HR**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **Exercise angina**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **ST depression**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope of ST**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (values 1, 2, 3)
- **Number of vessels fluro**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **Thallium**: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- **Heart Disease**: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

### Problem Statement
Given the enhanced dataset of 270 patients with their respective clinical parameters and additional features, 
the goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a patient has heart disease (Heart Disease = 1) 
or not (Heart Disease = 0). The challenge is to develop a model with high accuracy and reliability to be used as a
potential tool for early diagnosis in clinical settings.
